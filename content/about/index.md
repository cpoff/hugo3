I’m Curt Poff. I’ve worked as a producer/project manager for the past 15 years. I’m married to the lovely [Go Fit Girl!](http://gofitgirl.com). We recently relocated to Tucson via Portland and  the Bay Area. Good to be back in the sun.

I’m a huge sports fan. My teams include the Kansas City Royals, Chiefs, Mizzou, Newcastle United (It's a long story), Portland State, Timbers, and Trail Blazers. It’s a lot, I know.
