I am Curt Poff. I’ve worked as a producer/project manager for the past 15 years at Macworld, Walmart.com, and Nike (as a contractor). I also went through the Javascript Immersion program at now-defunct Portland Code School.

I’m married to the lovely [Go Fit Girl!](http://gofitgirl.com) We recently relocated to Tucson via Portland and  the Bay Area. Good to be back in the sun.

Fair to say I am a huge sports fan. My teams include the Kansas City Royals, Chiefs, Mizzou, Newcastle United (It's a long story), Portland State, Timbers, and Trail Blazers. It’s a lot, I know.
