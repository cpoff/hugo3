Having spent the past couple months wrestling with Jekyll and Ruby gems - or more specifically: gem dependancies - I sought a new static site generator.

<!--more-->

After perusing [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/) a few times and trying out various test deploys on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) using their handy tools, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) came out the winner. It's written with Go and the templating seemed straightforward and I can still produce alll of my updates using Markdown. Everything else basically came down to editing the config file. I got my tips from the [Hyde-Hyde theme how-to](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hyde-hyde/).

I still have my curtpoff.com homepage and resume living elsewhere. But [GitHub](https://github.com) Pages is no longer involved.
