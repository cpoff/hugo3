Yesterday I re-installed an advanced version of my Jekyll blog that included a new theme. Hope you find it suitable.

The [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) construction seems well suited for my needs. It has all the social buttons and plug-ins I need. There are about half a dozen stock themes, so don't be surprised if you see a few of them over the coming months.

Also let it be know that I'm extremely satisfied running my blog on [GitHub](https://github.com). They provide free hosting as long as you don't require much advanced functionality. The Jekyll platform - which is a static site construction - is lightning fast and extremely secure. And you can't beat the price.

More things to come, I'm sure. But I feel like [my homepage](http://curtpoff.com) and blog are starting to take shape.

**Update:** The top nav should now be both responsive and sticky. The only catch is that it isn't sticky once it collapses. I'll see if there's anyway to fix that.
