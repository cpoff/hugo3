As [I mentioned](/posts/new-hugo-site/ "Hugo now running this site"), I'm now running a Hugo static site generator. It's going great so far so I decided to install a CMS as phase 2.

The open-source CMS I'm running is built by [Forestry](https://forestry.io "Forestry.io"). And it only took a little tinkering to get the template configuration solved. 

I spent an hour or so trying to build a new template from scratch (which I almost got completed) before I came across a paragraph in their docs detailing how I could find an existing post and create a new template from it. Turns out all I had to do was [RTFM](https://forestry.io/docs/quickstart/configure-cms/).
