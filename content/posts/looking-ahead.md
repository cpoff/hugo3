The Nike contract ran out just before the holidays. I had three contract extensions, running for 18 months total. I interviewed for a few gigs but it looks like my days with *The Swoosh* are over. So Ann and I are both wondering what's next.

Of course we don't want to move. We've been in PDX for three years and love the place and the lovely friends we've made here. But the weather is rough on Ann (the Arizona native) and we're in the middle of a relatively cold winter. Can't say she'd hate moving back to a warmer climate.

So stay tuned for news on that front.
