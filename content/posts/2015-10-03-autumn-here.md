Baseball playoffs are about to begin, meaningful football games, and fall colors about hit peak season. I love this time of year.

<!--more-->

Kansas City Royals are in good shape for a playoff run once again. But I don't expect they'll do quite as good as last year. It's still great rooting for my original pro sport team.

Mizzou has been up/down and are about to be consumed by a QB controversy. The upcoming trip to Athens Georgia probably won't help matters either.

Portland State Vikings are still making noise and are now ranked in FCS. I'll withhold judgement until after both Montana schools visit Portland.

Chiefs are maddening, as always. Flashes of great, but always followed by something colossally unfortunate.

Great time to be a sports fan.
