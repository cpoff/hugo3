[Cheesemas](/cheesemas/) went off without a hitch and everyone had a wonderful time. Now it's time to sit back and enjoy some holiday laziness. Football, binge-watching TV shows, homemade posole. It's all in the cards.

Yesterday was Christmas and we just lounged around the house. Ann and I had our feast the previous night - as is our tradition. Ann taught a yoga workshop in the afternoon, then we went for an evening showing of the new Star Wars movie at the [Baghdad Theatre](http://www.mcmenamins.com/219-bagdad-theater-pub-home). Good times.

The weather has been terrible here. Cold and rainy, but not enough for snow. For now I just take my daily walk when the weather looks suitable.

Tonight we're joining another couple for pizza and beers at a new place in Multnomah Village. But for now it's all football and Game of Thrones (which happens to be airing all previous seasons over the coming days on HBO).
