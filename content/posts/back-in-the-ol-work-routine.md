Made the four-week mark today. Pima Association of Governments is a Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) performing transportation planning for the Pima County area. I'm their new webmaster, running an older pair of sites and preparing for potential replatform down the road.

Everyone has been great so far, and they're all eager for improvements. This is the first job I've ever had where I participate in a pension scheme. I hope this one goes the distance. Hopefully ten-to-twelve years is all I need.
