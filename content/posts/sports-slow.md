The NFL playoffs are down to the final four and my Chiefs are now eliminated. Rough finish to a rough season. Thus begins the slow season for sports.

Normally this time of year I'd turn my attention to Mizzou and Arizona MBB. All this as a lead-up to the NCAA tourney and our annual trip to Las Vegas. But the Tigers are in the crapper (yet again), so it's down to the Arizona Wildcats to fill my time. I've also been following the Trail Blazers but they're in rebuilding mode. Not much to see there.

By the time college hoops runs its course we'll have both MLS and MLB back in season.
