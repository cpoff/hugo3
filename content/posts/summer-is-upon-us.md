I planted my garden the first week of March, and this week I've seen both tomatoes and peppers bear fruit.

The Celebrity Hybrid tomato was first, then today I noticed a nice little Cubanelle pepper.

I did a broad range of varieties for both. We had very good luck with both tomatoes and peppers in Oakland. Not sure how either will do once it starts getting really hot. Yesterday it got well into the 90s and spring has just started.

I also did Butterleaf lettuce this winter and it did great. I'm still chopping fresh leaves twice a week. The Garlic Chive and Rosemary are also strong. My Sweet Basil not so much. Two straight plants have started strong then fizzled. I tried re-positioning the second plant to direct sun, but still no luck.
