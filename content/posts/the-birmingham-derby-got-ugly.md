Today's match between Birmingham City and Aston Villa saw a disturbing act of fan violence. A City fan ran onto the pitch and threw the definition of a sucker punch at Villa captain Jack Grealish. Here's [_The Guardian_'s report](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/10/aston-villa-jack-grealish-attacked-by-spectator-birmingham-city "The Guardian's reort").

Fan violence is nothing new in English football. But typically it involves pre- or post-game scuffles between rival supporters groups outside the stadium. Even to this day, visiting supporter sections are ringed with uniformed stewards who keep the rival factions away from each other. On-pitch problems are rare and deserve harsh, severe punishment.

Of course I learned of today's incident while watching Arsenal vs. Man U on NBCSN. They showed the Birmingham incident during halftime. When they cut back to the match, Arlo White (who grew up supporting Leicester City, not really a '[prawn sandwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prawn_sandwich_brigade)' crowd) talked about how we need to keep in mind the 'dark days' of English football or risk reverting to a time when fans were literally kept in cages. That really summed it all up for me.

Quick background: Up to the 1990s, most big stadia in England contained fenced terraces. Those are just concrete platforms where the tickets sold were cheap and had no seats. If you had a ticket for a section, you just crowded in wherever there was room. As a result, clubs would often oversell each of those sections and just let the SRO fans deal with it.

So you wound up with gigantic steel barriers between the players and fans. And most visitors sections were completely enclosed by barriers. It wasn't - by any stretch of the imagination - a pleasant setting.

Then 100 people got crushed in the [Hillsborough disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster "Hillsborough disaster").

The resulting inquest after that tragedy placed a lot of the blame on crowd control, policing of crowds, and stadium configuration. It now requires that every ticket sold in the top two tiers of English football has to be for an assigned seat. No more standing terraces, and the eventual elimination of the steel barriers between the fans and pitch.

I've been to more sports events than I can count. Sometimes alone, often times with family and friends, I've had words with opposing fans, seen plenty of shoving matches and plenty of hands thrown. But I've never EVER feared for my own safety.

I've taken my wife to the World Cup, to Azteca Stadium in Mexico City, and to one of the biggest stadiums in the English Premiere League (St. James Park). I'm pretty sure she's never felt threatened.

Crowd control isn't easy. But it's a policy-level decision: How crowds are moved into and out-of confined spaces, who (if any) monitors and stands between fans and the action. England learned those practices the hard way. And now it appears as though some people have either forgotten - or never knew about - the totally unpleasant environment they've moved on from.

Back to today's match in Birmingham: Grealish gave the final, ultimate FUCK YOU to City fans as he netted the only goal in [Villa's 1-0 win](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/47431193 "BBC game report").

Birmingham City FC released a statement saying the fan who attacked Grealish will be banned for life. But I'm not sure how enforceable that punishment will be. Hopefully local police - who already have him under arrest - will take more severe measures.
