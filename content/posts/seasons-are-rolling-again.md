Last winter was brutal, but the seasonal changes since then have been pretty nice. Long spring (blah), warm summer, lovely colors this fall, now returning to winter.

Won't be going back to Missouri for deer season this year. That's the first time in probably 20 years I haven't done so. Sorry to be missing out.

The wife and I will likely be spending Thanksgiving here again this year. Expect a ham ordered from <a href="https://smokehouse.com">Burgers' Smokehouse</a> in California, Mo.
