Each spring Tucson hosts a small-ish soccer tournament called the [Mobile Mini Sun Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Mobile_Mini_Sun_Cup "Mobile Mini Sun Cup"). It's pretty much an MLS version of the Cactus League involving several MLS teams, [Phoenix Rising](https://www.phxrisingfc.com/ "Phoenix Rising") (USL), and [FC Tucson](https://www.fctucson.com/ "FC Tucson") (USL League One) playing a round-robin format and numerous exhibitions in between.

This year was great because my beloved Timbers returned and so did our natural rivals from Seattle. Each MLS team only plays four 'cup' matches so it seemed only natural that Portland vs. Seattle would be on the schedule.

Timbers have all kinds of regional groups on the West Coast, including Arizona. The [Desert Corps](https://twitter.com/desertcorps "Timbers Army: Desert Corps") was pretty organized and did a good job getting everyone informed about events well in advance. So Ann and I joined them at the well-attended tailgate. Here's a shot of us, and my newly acquired DC scarf.

Throw in a cooler full of beers and some grilled meats. Good times and a pretty social bunch of folks.

Gametime was pretty exciting. It's a pre-season game but the [Timbers Army](https://timbersarmy.org/ "Timbers Army") did its thing. We occupied (almost) the entire section, rolled out a fine TIFO after the national anthem, and kept the chants running through the whole match. Speaking of which, Portland won 2-1 with goals by Diego Valeri (PK) and Jeremy Ebobissie (assist by Dairon Asprilla).

Next up for Portland is NY Red Bull this weekend.
