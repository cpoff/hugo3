Over the years, my wife and I got into the habit of eating most meals separately. The idea evolved from Annâ€™s dietary needs. She eats pretty healthy. I usually piece together what I can.

Since we returned to the Pacific Northwest - with both of us being around the house more - we have started eating a lot of fresh fish. Salmon and steelhead in particular.

My favorite thing about salmon is that it requires very little help. You bake for 10-15 minutes and send it straight to the plate with no need for oil or sauce.

Pair it with some green beans and garlic toast and you have my go-to meal for 2015.
