[Cathering Bracy](https://twitter.com/cbracy) paid her first visit to Oregon, and we happily played host on the Portland wing of her expedition.

Ann and I always like to show people around town, usually with food and beverages high on the priority list. Plus some books added for good measure. The agenda included: one lunch and beers at Blue Moon in NW Portland, a fantastic lunch (the next day) at Little Bird followed by some wine tasting in Pioneer Square. Books at Powell's (natch). Wrapped up with a fantastic dinner/drinks at Montage.

In between meals we pretty much spent our time in pajamas, playing board games and watching Australian Open tennis. And the Apple TV filled in the remaining hours. It also helped that she brought a growler full of Krux k√∂lsch and we had a fully stocked wine selection. Local and otherwise.

Today she fled the confining spaces of metropolitan life and headed for the Oregon Coast. Smart woman.

Anyway, Catherine joins an elite club. That being people who are always welcome around our place.
