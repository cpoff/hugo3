People typically have a predictable opinion of Portland weather. Gray and rainy, with flashes of warm and sunny. This winter has lived up to all stereotypes.

Winter started back in late October. My buddy [Martin visited](https://blog.curtpoff.com/big-october) from Germany and was greeted with cold rain. Then late in December we had a legitimate winter storm. Snow and ice stayed on the ground for several days.

Then in January and February it just got dreary. Cold and dark for days/weeks on end. That's still going on now as March approaches. You can already see buds coming out on the trees. And some of the cherry trees are already blooming. I imagine the whole lot will explode once we get a string of consecutive warm, sunny days.

I'll enjoy spring once it gets here. It hasn't yet.
