I now have a valid (and secure) website hosted at [curtpoff.com](https://curtpoff.com). You may also notice that I've successfully installed a CNAME record pointing this blog to a subdomain of curtpoff.com.

Not sure why that took so long but it's finally finished. I also purchased the cpoff.com domain (thanks for the cheap sale, namecheap.com) and set a permanent redirect to the curtpoff.com site. That page is pretty much a fancy 'business card' site built using Bootstrap. There won't be many updates to the page contents. All updates will continue appear on the blog.

I plan to keep using the (free!) GitHub Pages/Jekyll system to run the blog. It's working well and I feel comfortable using it. It also provides all the functionality I need.
