After trying to book an Airbnb-type room in Phoenix for this Saturday night, I discovered the quoted price was anything but accurate.

<!--more-->

I went to my favorite [flight/hotel search website](https://hipmunk.com) and did my search. One-night stay around downtown Phoenix so we can visit Kate/Jason who happen to be in town on family business. Nothing big. Just drive up on Saturday, do some socializing, then get up on Sunday for a brunch before heading home.

Rooms around downtown are rather pricey. So I was delighted to find a one-bedroom apartment available right next to the Arizona Center for $148. It was offered through Booking.com so I filled out my forms and made the reservation. Easy enough, right?

I immediately got the confirmation. It listed my rate ($148), the taxes/feeds (another $20), then threw in a 'cleaning fee' for $65. That's where I call bullshit. 

I contacted both Booking.com and the shady rental property -
[Stay Alfred Union at Roosevelt](https://www.stayalfred.com/property/stay-alfred-at-union-roosevelt) - and argued that the cleaning fee should be built into the room rate. Anyway, I made my case that the fee was expected to be part of the rate and I didn't agree to such a drastic charge as an add-on. Long story short: I won that arguement and they canceled my booking without any charges. 

But then I started perusing Airbnb and found pretty much the same thing. There are a TON of available bookings in PHX where the room rate is around $100-150 but the 'total cost' for one night is over $200. Chalk it all up to the ridiculous fee for a service that hotels have been providing free of charge for centuries.

Soon after I got the cancellation sorted, we re-booked at a Marriott's SpringHill Suites in that same downtown area. Same original price without the added cleaning gouge.
