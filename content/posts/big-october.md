October is typically a busy month in our household. Ann's birthday, our anniversary, plus almost every other anniversary on the planet. Another big birthday this year belongs to one of my best friends: Ken Conforti. Ken and I were roommates back in the late '90s. He turns the big 5-0 next week.

It's already a big birthday but this year another great friend of ours - Martin Spanninger - is coming all the way from Germany to celebrate the big day. He'll spend 10 days in Portland, probably drinking beer and watching American sports on TV the whole time. Fine by me.

Martin and I both went to Portland State and we both know this town pretty well. I'm sure there will also be a trip to the coast or Hood River for a hike.

At least we have tickets for one Timbers game and a pre-season Blazers game. That should be enough to keep us occupied.
