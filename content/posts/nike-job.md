Last week I started work at Nike. It's a contract gig for upwards of a year, but on-site at the company HQ in Beaverton. I'm very excited.

But most of all I'm grateful to my wife. Ann allowed me to go unemployed for nearly 18 months. I know she was confident I'd eventually land something reasonable, but I'm sure she choked back some critisicm along the way. Glad she did.

So with that I'm now back to the daily grind. Best part is that Nike seems to have a fantastic corporate culture and I'm loving my job so far. I'll share more details once I convert to regular, full-time employment down the road. I don't want to jabber about the job here as I don't want to jeopardize my career outlook.
