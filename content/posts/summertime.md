description: Our second Fourth of July in the new house went just as expected.

---
Ann and I went over to the mother-in-law's for a cookout. Since it's 109F outside, we basically sat around the living room and chatted. All good. Very hot. Life in the new house is going great.

Geordie isn't really going outside much in this yeat. Understandable. He basically pees early in the morning then does another in the evening. In between it's just extended naptime. Also understandable.
