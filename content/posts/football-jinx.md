Two weeks ago I shot my mouth off about how every single football team in my corner happened to win. Royals, Chiefs (went on the road to thump the Texans), Mizzou (looked horrible against an inferior opponent), Arizona, Portland State (knocked off Washington State for the school's first ever win against a Pac-12 opponent).

No sooner had the words flowed from my keyboard that I realized the jinx. Sure enough, every single one of those teams took an ass-whuppin' the following week except Arizona (they played N. Arizona) and PSU.

Plus BOTH of my fantasy football teams - in very competitive leagues - went down in flames. I had one team where both WRs and one RB scored 0 (zero!) points.

Oooof!!
