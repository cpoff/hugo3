Our friend Monica visited us this weekend. She and her husband Giovanni (both Italians) are friends of ours from the Bay Area. They were in Ann's cycle class at the gym and we got to know each other over the years.

Monica came to support Ann, and take all of her cycle and yoga classes over the weekend. She did just that. I think she also enjoyed a little break away from taking care of the family for a few days. Boozy girl brunches and such.

We had a lot of family visits over the summer which was very nice. But Monica is the first 'friend' to book a visit. We were very happy to host. Hopefully she can visit again soon and maybe get her workaholic husband to join. We promise to have limoncello on hand.
