This weekend's temps are expected to be in the mid-80s. Can't say I'm terribly upset about that.

I know my parents endured a frigid stretch this winter back in Missouri. Happy to do my modest gardening plan and get the backyard cleaned up again, and ready for spring.

Also: We're dog-sitting Riptide for 24 hours. His mama went up to Phoenix to volunteer at a medical event. He's a little more nervous than Geordie and very sensitive to certain noises. Of course we live in next to a giant USAF base, so jets are pretty common.

Good news is his Thunder Shirt seems to calm him down, plus he already found Geordie's "safe space." That's the dark, quiet nook in the spare room where he can retreat when frightening noises appear.
