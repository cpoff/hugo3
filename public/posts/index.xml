      <description>&lt;p&gt;Each spring Tucson hosts a small-ish soccer tournament called the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Mobile_Mini_Sun_Cup&#34; title=&#34;Mobile Mini Sun Cup&#34;&gt;Mobile Mini Sun Cup&lt;/a&gt;. This year was great because my beloved Timbers returned and so did our natural rivals from Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Well that was easy. Chiefs got knocked out in the AFC Championship, so I had no reason to watch.
Instead, Ann and I had a nice dinner at Dante&amp;rsquo;s Fire down on Grant. They had happy hour pricing and we enjoyed a pretty good small-plate feast.
Then we went to see Vice at Roadhouse Cinema. It&amp;rsquo;s a decent theater chain that offers full recliner chairs, waitstaff service, with full bar and food menu.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After trying to book an Airbnb-type room in Phoenix for this Saturday night, I discovered the quoted price was anything but accurate. Shady practices seem to be pretty common tho.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Nike contract ran out just before the holidays. I had three contract extensions, running for 18 months total. I interviewed for a few gigs but it looks like my days with &lt;em&gt;The Swoosh&lt;/em&gt; are over. So Ann and I are both wondering what&amp;rsquo;s next.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People typically have a predictable opinion of Portland weather. Gray and rainy, with flashes of warm and sunny. This winter has lived up to all stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things you have to deal with when you relocate is changes to your regional sports affiliation. Yeah, Portland has the Timbers and Blazers. But what else is in our TV market?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Another big birthday this year belongs to one of my best friends: Ken Conforti. Ken and I were roommates back in the late &amp;lsquo;90s. He turns the big 5-0 next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My wife - Ann Chihak Poff - turns 41 on Friday. Check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://gofitgirl.com/&#34;&gt;her blog&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ll agree that she may be the most lovely 41-year-old on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Time to play with some Jekyll themes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that I have the Jekyll basics down, I&amp;rsquo;m going to start tweaking some theme/template options. I want more stuff in the header, and more obvious linking between this blog and my GitHub profile. I&amp;rsquo;m not convinced the simple footer does enough.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Baseball playoffs are about to begin, meaningful football games, and fall colors about hit peak season. I love this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our friend Monica visited us this weekend. She and her husband Giovanni (both Italians) are friends of ours from the Bay Area. They were in Ann&amp;rsquo;s cycle class at the gym and we got to know each other over the years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago I shot my mouth off about how every single football team in my corner happened to win. Royals, Chiefs (went on the road to thump the Texans), Mizzou (looked horrible against an inferior opponent), Arizona, Portland State (knocked off Washington State for the school&amp;rsquo;s first ever win against a Pac-12 opponent).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Job search strategy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to several companies about web developer jobs, it&amp;rsquo;s clear the market is more competitive than I originally estimated. I&amp;rsquo;ve been dead-set against pursuing internships or volunteer opportunities in favor of a full-time (&lt;em&gt;paid&lt;/em&gt;) role. I plan to maintain that strategy for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel like I finally have a grip on Jekyll as it runs in GitHub Pages. It took several attempts to install the Jekyll engine (parser) inside the existing directory and setup, but it seems to be working. I had to delete the Pages directory a couple times and it looks like I lost some update counts. But whatevs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I recently installed the Jekyll blog engine on my GitHub Pages site. All good so far but the configuration is going to take some time.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Summer is drawing to a close here in Portland, and I&amp;rsquo;m still looking for work. I had a good month of job search once my code class was done. But no solid offers came from it. So I&amp;rsquo;ll continue the search.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years, my wife and I got into the habit of eating most meals separately. The idea evolved from Ann’s dietary needs. She eats pretty healthy. I usually piece together what I can.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today several of us from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.portlandcodeschool.com&#34;&gt;Portland Code School&lt;/a&gt; took a tour of &lt;a href=&#34;http://panic.com/&#34;&gt;Panic Software&lt;/a&gt;. We do about one tour a week and this one was pretty unique.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
