    <p>I&rsquo;d like to offer a summary on <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2016/01/oregon_standoff.html">the standoff going on out in the eastern part of Oregon</a>. It&rsquo;s complicated but I&rsquo;ll try to use adequate sourcing.</p>

<p>The central figures are a father/son team named Hammond. Dwight Hammond Jr., 73, and Steven Hammond, 46. They were <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao-or/pr/eastern-oregon-ranchers-convicted-arson-resentenced-five-years-prison">convicted of arson</a> by a jury, sentenced to time, then re-sentenced because the original judge was deemed to be too lenient. Additional claims that they set the blazes in order to conceal vast poaching were also mentioned.</p>

<p>Arson is a <strong>felony</strong> and carries a five-year minimum sentence. On Monday the Hammonds reported to a federal prison in California. They committed arson and are doing mandatory five years. End of story.</p>

<p>Important to note: The Hammonds were tried by a jury in Pendleton, Oregon. That&rsquo;s a good ol&rsquo; boy Mecca. Not exactly a tree-hugging liberal bastion. I&rsquo;ve been to the fantastic rodeo up there - <a href="http://www.pendletonroundup.com/">the Pendleton Roundup</a> - with my parents and I&rsquo;d recommend to everyone. But make no mistake: There&rsquo;s no way a government railroad job could pass through a jury of rancher peers. No f*&amp;#!@# way.</p>

<p>Then recently the &lsquo;militia&rsquo; showed up in Burns, led by the Bundys. This is the family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundy_standoff">you may remember from a flare-up</a> not long ago in Nevada. The family rails against the government and all. It&rsquo;s fine. But they came to Oregon to support the Hammonds even though no such request was ever made. They just want the attention.</p>

<p>Now they&rsquo;ve holed up in a federal faciilty outside Burns. They say they&rsquo;ll stay as long as it takes, alhough no one&rsquo;s clear what their demands are other than returning all federal land to ranchers. Not sure how that will happen. They&rsquo;re basically a bunch of anti-government crackpots looking for a spotlight. Hopefully the FBI will quietly cut off their Internet access, deny food, then offer to fill up their gas tanks if they agree to head home. Problem solved.</p>

<p>I know land disputes between ranchers and the government date all the way back to the beginning of the BLM. I don&rsquo;t have a dog in that fight. But federal land is maintained for the common good and managed accordingly. Ranchers can graze but can&rsquo;t exercise absolute control in certain matters (water management, controlled burns, etc.). No way the management of public land will work out perfectly to everyone&rsquo;s liking. But at least let the government manage range land as best they can. Understand that what&rsquo;s best for you personally may not necessarily be best for all.</p>

<p>Then this evening I had a lively (but civil) exchange on FB with a good friend and the word &lsquo;terrorism&rsquo; came into play. He circulated a petition claiming justice for the Hammonds, who it claimed were convicted of secret terrorism charges. Totally untrue. The claim of terrorism - as noted in <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2016-01-01/oregon-ranching-case-sparks-anti-government-sentiment">the AP report my friend presented as evidence</a> - came from an e-mail sent by Ammon Bundy to stir up reactions. Well done, Ammon.</p>

<p>The terrorism claim is cloudy to me but appears to be part of the original charge. It&rsquo;s not entirely clear the way that article is written. Poor news writing, I&rsquo;ll admit it could be clearer. But still. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_occupation_of_the_Malheur_National_Wildlife_Refuge">Wikipedia article on this topic</a> has a better breakdown of the terrorist aspect. It has alot to do with commiting felonies on federal property.</p>

<p>So with that I&rsquo;d like to point out that a whole bunch of armed (entirely white) folks have seized a federal facility in the United States in support of an arsonist duo who have alrealdy reported to prison.</p>

<p>Two questions come from all this. <strong>(Todd, this bit is specifically for you)</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you really want to throw your support behind two convicted arsonists? If you want justice, I&rsquo;d first ask you to explain how it has not already been administered.<br /></li>
<li>And how would you react if this occupation of federal property was going on in suburban Kansas City &hellip; and the armed folks were black? Would you be so eager to post petitions in support?<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>
