<h1>Cheesemas is here!</h1>
<p>This Saturday we&rsquo;ll host our annual holiday party, also known as Cheesemas. How that party got to this point is a long story.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Ann and I moved to the Bay Area is early 2005. We didn&rsquo;t know many folks and didn&rsquo;t have much of a social schedule. <a href="https://twitter.com/philipmichaels">Phil Michaels</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lschmeiser">Lisa Schmeiser</a> were recently married and moved to town not long after us. Phil being my boss, we talked frequently and wasn&rsquo;t long before he and Lisa invited the wife and I over for dinner. We got along great.</p>

<p>We would go to their Alameda house for three types of events: sports, election coverage, holiday. Phil and I both being baseball and soccer fans, sports was our maintstay. Election coverage was also a good annual treat. I remember watchin both Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s Calif. governor re-election and Obama&rsquo;s big win at Casa Schmichaels.</p>

<p>But Cheesemas was our crown jewel. Our holiday franchise.</p>

<p>Lisa sent us a holiday invite in <sup>2005</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> for &lsquo;cheesemas.&rsquo; We came over, ate cheese, and guzzled adult beverages. Phil and Lisa - both being professional media consumers and reviewers - said they had a horribly fantastic holiday movie that we should watch. Rob Lowe&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Christmas Shoes&rsquo; was queued up and followed by surly, obscene poetry.</p>

<p>Cheesemas has been our primary holiday event ever since. It follows a very rigid agenda: Invite adults to join for cocktails. Everyone brings a cheese-y dish to share. Get everyone primed with a few drinks before we fire up the holiday special for the British clay-mation classic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DUf27qvRo0">Creature Comforts</a>. All good holiday stuff.</p>

<p>Refreshments refilled we move on to the feature presentation. The Christmas Shoes is a horribly predictable and clich√© holiday stinker. It&rsquo;s a movie based on a cheesy holiday song by a Christian rock band. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq10bz3PxyY">No joke</a>. But it&rsquo;s Rob Lowe&rsquo; first project after he left &lsquo;West Wing&rsquo; so you know he&rsquo;s at the height of his carrer, right? No chance. It&rsquo;s a terrible movie and we spend 90 minutes heckling the entire script and all associated with it.</p>

<p>Phil wrote a <a href="http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/mondo-extra/the-christmas-shoes/">seminal review</a> of the film. Well worth reading.</p>

<p>And so goes the story of Cheesemas. This Saturday Ann and I will welcome a new crowd of adults to our Portland home. The location is new, but we hope the long-established and beloved tradition lives on.</p>
