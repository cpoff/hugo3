<h1>Move to Portland</h1>
<p>Our good friend Eric Blumenau came to town for work this week with his girlfriend, Danielle Reichner. We had a great time showing them around town.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;d had a few too many beers (very likely), maybe they brought it out in me, maybe I was just an idiot. But whatever the reason I found myself trying to convince them to move to Portland. Pretty good jobs, great quality of living, outdoor activities out the wazoo. The whole shebang.</p>

<p>This is probably going to be the case for anyone who happens to visit. I can&rsquo;t help it. I just love this place.</p>

<p>The only drawbacks I consistently point out are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The weather. We get four seasons. Hot summer (especially this year), cold winter, and two very rainy and inconsistent transitions through fall and spring. It is what it is. Enjoy the good times and deal with the bad.</p></li>

<li><p>The lack of diversity. This one is a bit tougher. Portland is overwhelmingly white. I only notice because I used to live in Oakland, one of the most multi-cultural cities on the planet. Now we live alongside a giant loaf of Wonder bread.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>All that being what it is, Portland is still a great place to relocate. Jobs for tech folks are somewhat plentiful (I&rsquo;m testing that theory now), the surrounding mountains and beaches are world class, and the booming beer and food scenes are just as good.</p>

<p>I hope I convinced my friends to give PDX a serious look. And if anyone else wants to be convince, just let me know. I&rsquo;m willing and able.</p>
