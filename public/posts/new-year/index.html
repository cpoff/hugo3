<h1>Here&#39;s to a new year</h1>
<p>2015 was a transitional year for me. The lovely wife and I relocated, changed careers, and left a great group of friends and colleagues in the Bay Area. It&rsquo;s been a challenge, but I&rsquo;m very excitied about the future.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go somewhere new and start something new. We both did.</p>

<p>Ann went to work as soon as we arrived in PDX. She started teaching regular indoor cycling and yoga classes at various gyms/studios. It&rsquo;s been great. She keeps a regular professional schedule and alots time to speak to students. She takes it seriously.</p>

<p>I went to school. Portland Codes School&rsquo;s javascript immersion program went three months over the summer. I took the primer class in the spring so I was prepared. I spent the entire autumn and a portion of winter searching for work. I had several good talks but no job offers materialized. I have a couple conversations going now and am very optimistic. Looking forward to getting back to work. Into a regular schedule again.</p>

<p>We also look forward to traveling again, something we can only do as a dual-income family. Looking forward to picking through the greatest hits when we formulate our Xmas cards.</p>

<p>I hope 2016 treats everyone well.</p>
