      <description>&lt;p&gt;2015 was a transitional year for me. The lovely wife and I relocated, changed careers, and left a great group of friends and colleagues in the Bay Area. It&amp;rsquo;s been a challenge, but I&amp;rsquo;m very excitied about the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;October is typically a busy month in our household. Ann&amp;rsquo;s birthday, our anniversary, plus almost every other anniversary on the planet. Another big birthday this year belongs to one of my best friends: Ken Conforti. Ken and I were roommates back in the late &amp;lsquo;90s. He turns the big 5-0 next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
