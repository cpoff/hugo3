      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s match between Birmingham City and Aston Villa (both sides in the second tier of English football) saw a disturbing act of fan violence. A City fan ran onto the pitch at St. Andrew&amp;rsquo;s and threw the definition of a sucker punch at Villa captain Jack Grealish.
Here&amp;rsquo;s The Guardian&amp;rsquo;s report.
Fan violence is nothing new in English football. But typically it involves pre- or post-game scuffles between rival supporters groups outside the stadium.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Each spring Tucson hosts a small-ish soccer tournament called the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Mobile_Mini_Sun_Cup&#34; title=&#34;Mobile Mini Sun Cup&#34;&gt;Mobile Mini Sun Cup&lt;/a&gt;. This year was great because my beloved Timbers returned and so did our natural rivals from Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Well that was easy. Chiefs got knocked out in the AFC Championship, so I had no reason to watch.
Instead, Ann and I had a nice dinner at Dante&amp;rsquo;s Fire down on Grant. They had happy hour pricing and we enjoyed a pretty good small-plate feast.
Then we went to see Vice at Roadhouse Cinema. It&amp;rsquo;s a decent theater chain that offers full recliner chairs, waitstaff service, with full bar and food menu.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things you have to deal with when you relocate is changes to your regional sports affiliation. Yeah, Portland has the Timbers and Blazers. But what else is in our TV market?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The NFL playoffs are down to the final four and my Chiefs are now eliminated. Rough finish to a rough season. Thus begins the slow season for sports.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I served up a massive jinx</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago I shot my mouth off about how every single football team in my corner happened to win. Royals, Chiefs (went on the road to thump the Texans), Mizzou (looked horrible against an inferior opponent), Arizona, Portland State (knocked off Washington State for the school&amp;rsquo;s first ever win against a Pac-12 opponent).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
