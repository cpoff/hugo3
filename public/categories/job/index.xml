      <description>&lt;p&gt;After interviewing for numerous roles at the UofA, Raytheon, and elsewhere around town, it became apparent that I&amp;rsquo;d do better by driving my own bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Nike contract ran out just before the holidays. I had three contract extensions, running for 18 months total. I interviewed for a few gigs but it looks like my days with &lt;em&gt;The Swoosh&lt;/em&gt; are over. So Ann and I are both wondering what&amp;rsquo;s next.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I started work at Nike. It&amp;rsquo;s a contract gig for upwards of a year, but on-site at the company HQ in Beaverton. I&amp;rsquo;m very excited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Job search strategy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to several companies about web developer jobs, it&amp;rsquo;s clear the market is more competitive than I originally estimated. I&amp;rsquo;ve been dead-set against pursuing internships or volunteer opportunities in favor of a full-time (&lt;em&gt;paid&lt;/em&gt;) role. I plan to maintain that strategy for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Summer is drawing to a close here in Portland, and I&amp;rsquo;m still looking for work. I had a good month of job search once my code class was done. But no solid offers came from it. So I&amp;rsquo;ll continue the search.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
