      <description>This poor guy showed up with an infected toe (which has since been amputated), a case of hookworms, numerous scars from god knows what kind of living conditions, and a big ol&amp;rsquo; smile. Don&amp;rsquo;t believe me?
He&amp;rsquo;s fitting in pretty well. We have an enclosed yard so he has free run to do his business. He&amp;rsquo;s attended several meet-and-greet events and has done very well at all. He&amp;rsquo;s also met all the local family members and most of their pets - doing very well at those too.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;October is typically a busy month in our household. Ann&amp;rsquo;s birthday, our anniversary, plus almost every other anniversary on the planet. Another big birthday this year belongs to one of my best friends: Ken Conforti. Ken and I were roommates back in the late &amp;lsquo;90s. He turns the big 5-0 next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
