      <description>I am Curt Poff. I’ve worked as a web producer/project manager for the past 15 years at Macworld, Walmart.com, and Nike (as a contractor). I also went through the Javascript Immersion program at now-defunct Portland Code School.
Here&amp;rsquo;s my homepage , my resume, and my company website.
I’m married to the lovely Go Fit Girl! We are now located in Tucson after stays in Portland and the Bay Area.
Fair to say I am a huge sports fan.</description>
