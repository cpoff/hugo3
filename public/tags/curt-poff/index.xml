      <description>I am Curt Poff. I’ve worked as a web producer/project manager for the past 15 years at Macworld, Walmart.com, and Nike (as a contractor). I also went through the Javascript Immersion program at now-defunct Portland Code School. Here&amp;rsquo;s where you can find my homepage and resume.
I’m married to the lovely Go Fit Girl! We recently relocated to Tucson after stays in Portland and the Bay Area. Good to be back in the sun.</description>
