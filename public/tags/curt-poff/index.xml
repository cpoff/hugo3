      <description>I’m Curt Poff. I’ve worked as a producer/project manager for the past 15 years at Macworld, Walmart.com, and Nike (as a contractor). I also went through the Javascript Immersion program at now-defunct Portland Code School.
I’m married to the lovely Go Fit Girl! We recently relocated to Tucson via Portland and the Bay Area. Good to be back in the sun.
Fair to say I am a huge sports fan. My teams include the Kansas City Royals, Chiefs, Mizzou, Newcastle United (It&amp;rsquo;s a long story), Portland State, Timbers, and Trail Blazers.</description>
