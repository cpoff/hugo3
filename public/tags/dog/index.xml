      <description>This poor guy showed up with an infected toe (which has since been amputated), a case of hookworms, numerous scars from god knows what kind of living conditions, and a big ol&amp;rsquo; smile. Don&amp;rsquo;t believe me?
He&amp;rsquo;s fitting in pretty well. We have an enclosed yard so he has free run to do his business. He&amp;rsquo;s attended several meet-and-greet events and has done very well at all. He&amp;rsquo;s also met all the local family members and most of their pets - doing very well at those too.</description>
