      <description>Last update was about the garden, so let me get that report out of the way: The peppers did great. Several Cubanelles, Anaheims, and Sante Fe Grandes. The latter was extra spicy, and the others were not.
I liked the Cubanelles because they provide that chile pepper flavor without a ton of heat. Just enough to make it zesty. The Anaheims were used for grilling. Throw them on with steaks and you&amp;rsquo;re all set.</description>

      <description>Made the four-week mark today. Pima Association of Governments is a Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) performing transportation planning for the Pima County area. I&amp;rsquo;m their new webmaster, running an older pair of sites and preparing for potential replatform down the road.
Everyone has been great so far, and they&amp;rsquo;re all eager for improvements. This is the first job I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had where I participate in a pension scheme. I hope this one goes the distance.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Each spring Tucson hosts a small-ish soccer tournament called the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Mobile_Mini_Sun_Cup&#34; title=&#34;Mobile Mini Sun Cup&#34;&gt;Mobile Mini Sun Cup&lt;/a&gt;. This year was great because my beloved Timbers returned and so did our natural rivals from Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
