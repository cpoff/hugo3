      <description>Well that was easy. Chiefs got knocked out in the AFC Championship, so I had no reason to watch.
Instead, Ann and I had a nice dinner at Dante&amp;rsquo;s Fire down on Grant. They had happy hour pricing and we enjoyed a pretty good small-plate feast.
Then we went to see Vice at Roadhouse Cinema. It&amp;rsquo;s a decent theater chain that offers full recliner chairs, waitstaff service, with full bar and food menu.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The NFL playoffs are down to the final four and my Chiefs are now eliminated. Rough finish to a rough season. Thus begins the slow season for sports.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago I shot my mouth off about how every single football team in my corner happened to win. Royals, Chiefs (went on the road to thump the Texans), Mizzou (looked horrible against an inferior opponent), Arizona, Portland State (knocked off Washington State for the school&amp;rsquo;s first ever win against a Pac-12 opponent).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
