      <description>Last update was about the garden, so let me get that report out of the way: The peppers did great. Several Cubanelles, Anaheims, and Sante Fe Grandes. The latter was extra spicy, and the others were not.
I liked the Cubanelles because they provide that chile pepper flavor without a ton of heat. Just enough to make it zesty. The Anaheims were used for grilling. Throw them on with steaks and you&amp;rsquo;re all set.</description>
