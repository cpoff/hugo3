      <description>Last update was about the garden, so let me get that report out of the way: The peppers did great. Several Cubanelles, Anaheims, and Sante Fe Grandes. The latter was extra spicy, and the others were not.
I liked the Cubanelles because they provide that chile pepper flavor without a ton of heat. Just enough to make it zesty. The Anaheims were used for grilling. Throw them on with steaks and you&amp;rsquo;re all set.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.curtpoff.com/cheesemas/&#34;&gt;Cheesemas&lt;/a&gt; went off without a hitch and everyone had a wonderful time. Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to sit back and enjoy some holiday laziness. Football, binge-watching TV shows, homemade posole. It&amp;rsquo;s all in the cards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
