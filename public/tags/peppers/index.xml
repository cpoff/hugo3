      <description>I planted my garden the first week of March, and this week I&amp;rsquo;ve seen both tomatoes and peppers bear fruit.
The Celebrity Hybrid tomato was first, then today I noticed a nice little Cubanelle pepper.
I did a broad range of varieties for both. We had very good luck with both tomatoes and peppers in Oakland. Not sure how either will do once it starts getting really hot. Yesterday it got well into the 90s and spring has just started.</description>
